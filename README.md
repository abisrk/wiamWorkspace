__Chatbot title__ : WIAM Chatbot

__Inspiration__ : We want to server our customers better by leveraging the Machine Learning and Natural language processing abilities of IBM Watson.

__Solution description__ :

The WIAM chatbot we are building, allows a user to :
[x] raise role requests 
[x] check current status of their requests 
[x] provide feedback on WIAM.

The chatbot makes the entire process very __interactive__ and __intutive__. The feedback collected is analyzed using IBM Watson NLP API to understand the __emotion__ (happy,sad,frustrated,angry etc) behind it. The feedback consolidated from all the users, can then be made available as a Dashboard to the management, to enable decisions.

__Built with__ :
IBM Watson Assistant
IBM Cloudant database
Python
Flask
