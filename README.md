__Chatbot title__ : WIAM Chatbot

__Inspiration__ : We want to server our customers better by leveraging the Machine Learning and Natural language processing abilities of IBM Watson.

__Solution description__ :

The WIAM chatbot allows a user to :
:white_check_mark: raise role requests 
:white_check_mark: check current status of their requests 
:white_check_mark: provide feedback on WIAM.

The chatbot makes the entire process very __interactive__ and __intutive__. The feedback collected is analyzed using IBM Watson NLP API to understand the __emotion__ (happy,sad,frustrated,angry etc) behind it. The feedback consolidated from all the users, can then be made available as a Dashboard to the management, to enable decisions.

The solution is designed to scale and is deployed on the IBM's bluemix cloud platform.

__Built with__ :

:small_blue_diamond: IBM Watson Tone Analyzer
:small_blue_diamond: IBM Cloudant database
:small_blue_diamond: Python
:small_blue_diamond: Flask
